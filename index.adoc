* Introduction
** 1 minute
** This is a story about the relationship between two programming languages and
how it has evolved over time.
*** One of them is Alda, a text-based music composition language.
*** The other is Clojure, a functional programming-oriented Lisp that runs on
the JVM.

* I like this excerpt of our Senior Open Source Engineer job posting:
** Adzerk is a world-class software platform for decision-making at scale.  Our
ever-growing list of customers include the most innovative applications and
publishers in the world, like Strava, Ticketmaster, Edmunds, WeTransfer, and
imgur.
** Great description of our product, emphasizing that we're essentially a
decision engine.
*** Can use the decision engine for ad serving, dynamic content selection or
other purposes.

* Elevator pitch for Alda
** 5 minutes
** Alda is a language for writing music in a text format.
** The text is your source code, which can parsed and interpreted by a playback
process, which allows you to hear the music that you're writing as you're
writing it.
** I was inspired to create Alda after I studied music composition and then I
got more into software development and I learned how I could use a text editor
and the command line to develop software interactively.
** I believe that a tight feedback loop is essential to unlocking your
creativity both when you're developing software and when you're composing music.

== Demo: Alda v1

* ðŸ•’ Time is of the essence! ðŸ•’
* To learn more about Alda:
** https://alda.io[alda.io] (docs, tutorial)
** https://github.com/alda-lang/alda[github.com/alda-lang/alda]
** Previous talks on YouTube

[.notes]

* 5 minutes
** See alda files in demo/alda-v1
** Keep explanations short!
** Objectives
*** Show some Alda code on screen and play it
*** Explain the role of inline Clojure code

The evolution of Alda's architecture
12 minutes to get through phases 1-4

This part is kind of a slog... I should probably try and speed through it as
much as I can. Avoid going into too much detail, just cover the facts. I can
always answer questions and go into more detail out of band. The real
interesting bits are really at the end, when I discuss alda-clj.

8 minutes for v2 wishlist, phase 5 and alda-clj
--

[%step]
* Move most functionality into the client
* Simple, lightweight player process
* Fast startup time / execution
* Support for live coding
** Edit a score on the fly while it's playing

== Phase 5: Client/player

== Open Sound Control (OSC)

* http://opensoundcontrol.org
* De facto standard for multimedia communication
* Transported over UDP
* Simple, open-ended message structure
** `/track/1/midi/note 2000 61 500 500 127`

== Phase 5: Client/player

* Going back to our phase 5 diagram, you'll notice that I haven't included any
Clojure or Java logos.
* That's because I've decided to change languages.

* Kotlin in the player process
** I wanted to stick with the JVM for now, as I've already figured out how to
use the javax.sound.midi sequencer and synthesizer as a backend for Alda.
** In the future, I may experiment with alternate backends.

* Go in the client
** Of the options I tried for languages that can produce native executables, Go
provided the least friction when it comes to cross-compiling programs to fully
static executables, absolutely no dynamic linking.
** Not my favorite language in the world, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
*** It turns out that the limitations of Go are actually its strength.
*** You can't do anything complicated, so your code ends up not being
complicated.

* So where does Clojure fit into the picture?

that doesn't require alda to be implemented in clojure
