* Introduction
** 1 minute
** This is a story about the relationship between two programming languages and
how it has evolved over time.
*** One of them is Alda, a text-based music composition language.
*** The other is Clojure, a functional programming-oriented Lisp that runs on
the JVM.

* Actually go to the website and talk through the instructions
* Mention that I'll pause before we begin and help anyone who's having trouble
  installing Alda.
* Talk a little about what PATH is, too.
* If you've done everything right, you should be able to run the commands here
  at the bottom of the page, and the last one will actually produce sound, just
  as a heads up.

== What is

[.notes]
--
* Elevator pitch for Alda
** 5 minutes
** Alda is a language for writing music in a text format.
** The text is your source code, which can parsed and interpreted by a playback
process, which allows you to hear the music that you're writing as you're
writing it.
** I was inspired to create Alda after I studied music composition and then I
got more into software development and I learned how I could use a text editor
and the command line to develop software interactively.
** I believe that a tight feedback loop is essential to unlocking your
creativity both when you're developing software and when you're composing music.

TODO:
* Is this slide necessary, or should I jump straight into showing Sibelius vs.
  TUI and telling the story of learning music composition in college, etc.?
* Create slides showing the "feedback loop" concept in software development and
  then in music composition.
* Either create a slide about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, or remove

* A Clojure library that drives the Alda CLI
* API docs via cljdoc
* You have full control of your Clojure program
** Can bring in Clojure libraries as dependencies
* Clojure's REPL-driven development style unlocks creativity
** Easier to experiment in a Clojure REPL than it is working with an Alda file
