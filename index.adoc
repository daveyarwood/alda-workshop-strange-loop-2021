* 2 minutes to talk through the points
* Add 5 minutes wiggle room in case someone needs help adding `alda` and
  `alda-player` to their PATH, or if there are any other issues.
* Actually go to the website and talk through the instructions
* Mention that I'll pause before we begin and help anyone who's having trouble
  installing Alda.
* Talk a little about what PATH is, too.
* If you've done everything right, you should be able to run the commands here
  at the bottom of the page, and the last one will actually produce sound, just
  as a heads up.

== What is

[.notes]
--
* 2 minutes
** Alda is a text-based music composition language
** You can write your scores in a text format, as an alternative to traditional
   sheet music. And I believe that there are benefits to writing music in a text
   format, which I'll describe shortly.
** Currently, the focus is on MIDI. Alda will play your scores using the MIDI
   synthesizer that's built into the Java Virtual Machine. Or you can use Alda
   to export a MIDI file, which you can do a lot of useful things with, such as
   importing it into a DAW, or importing it into a sheet music notation program
   if you want to convert your Alda score into traditional sheet music.
** I do have some grand plans for the future that involve stepping outside of
   MIDI and playing around with waveform synthesis and samplers and all of the
   fun that that entails.

== Music composition GUI

[.notes]
--
* 4 minutes
* Tell the story of when I was studying music composition in college, and I used
  Sibelius to notate the music that I was writing.
** Music composition GUI programs like Sibelius and Finale are chock full of
   features to the point that it can be disorienting. It can be difficult to
   find exactly what you're looking for when you're writing a score. And while
   you're trying to find it, you're likely to become distracted by a number of
   other things. Meanwhile, your focus is taken away from the one thing that
   really matters, which is the music that you're trying to write.
** After using Sibelius for a while, I really started to feel like it was
   cumbersome to get my musical ideas out in the form of sheet music.
*** Part of this was that it's physically difficult to drag the notes and other
    symbols around to be in exactly the place that you want them to go.
*** Another issue is something that my composition professor, Allen Anderson,
    cautioned us all about, which was that you should avoid _writing music_ in
    Sibelius/Finale at all costs. These programs should be solely for _notating_
    music. There is a real danger that these programs pose to your creativity if
    you are attempting to write music right there with the program in front of
    you. Because it's physically difficult to write music that is complex, you
    will end up, without even thinking about it, writing music that can tend to
    be boring and overly simplistic, simply because it's easier to notate in the
    program.
** So, for all of these reasons, in the back of my mind, I always had a vague
   feeling of dissatisfaction, like there had to be an easier way to notate
   musical ideas and combine them together to create scores.
* I was inspired to create Alda after I studied music composition and then I
got more into software development and I learned how I could use a text editor
and the command line to develop software interactively.
* I believe that a tight feedback loop is essential to unlocking your
creativity both when you're developing software and when you're composing music.

== The Feedback Loop

[.notes]
--
* 2 minutes
* I wasn't really a software developer yet. I had played around with programming
  as a kid, but I never really got into it until around my senior year of
  college, when I took Introduction to Programming as an elective class, and I
  learned some Java. Even then, I wasn't really introduced to what it was
  _really_ like to build software until about a year or two later when I started
  really learning Python, and then Ruby, and other languages, and I was writing
  programs in these languages and learning how to make them work.
* It was at that point that I learned about the software development feedback
  loop. You write some code, then you run the code, and you look at the feedback
  that you got from the compiler or the interpreter. Then you either celebrate
  your success, or you have to figure out what went wrong. Then that leads you
  to write more code, and then you run that code, and the cycle continues.
* At some point, I realized that the process of writing _music_ is also a
  feedback loop. You get a musical idea, and so you write it down. Then you play
  it back somehow, maybe that's through music notation software, or maybe you're
  just playing the music that you wrote back for yourself physically on your
  instrument. Then you think about how that sounded to your ears, and you adjust
  the music that you wrote down, and you iterate from there.
* This was starting to feel so similar to me to the software development
  feedback loop, that I began to have thoughts about developing music the way
  that I develop software, using a text editor and the command line as my
  feedback loop.

== Music composition TUI

[.notes]
--
* 3 minutes
* In stark contrast to the music notation GUI software that we saw a couple of
  slides ago, there is far less here to distract you. All you have is text on
  the screen, and a language that you can work with to express your musical
  ideas.
* Now, I do think there is a _little_ bit of a learning curve, so perhaps at
  first, this won't feel as efficient to you as, say, placing notes on a
  graphical canvas in a program like Sibelius. But once you get over that
  learning curve, I think you'll find that text-based music composition is a lot
  more efficient in terms of how fast you can notate a musical idea and hear it
  played back for you.
* Another significant benefit is that, because Alda isn't tethered to standard
  musical notation, it means that you can do a lot of bizarre and interesting
  things that would be very difficult to notate in traditional sheet music.
  You'll begin to realize the limitations that come with traditional sheet music
  notation, and how easy it is to go against the grain in Alda and try something
  different, and that experience feels really liberating.

* 3 minutes
* There is a principle called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, or the hypothesis of
  linguistic relativity. The idea is that the structure of a language or the
  ideas that can be expressed in that language have an effect on the speaker's
  ability to think and their perceptions about the world.

* 12 minutes
* Introduce accidentals
* Explain why there isn't a black key in between E/F, B/C
** If there were, we would have 14TET, not 12TET, and music would sound very
   different from what we're used to
* Explain (and demonstrate) notes sounding the same, but having a
  different enharmonic spelling (e.g. C# and Db, B# and C)

== The Circle of Fifths

image::circle-of-fifths.png[500,500]

[.notes]
--
* 11 minutes
* Walk through constructing scales, with correct accidentals based on the key
* Allude to there being an easier way to work with keys in Alda
* Introduce the `key-signature` attribute
** Good opportunity to move to using a text editor
** Resist the temptation to do `key-sig!` at the top of the score, too much
information for right now.
** Necessary short breakdown of Lisp, why the single quote in:
*** `(key-sig '(a major))`
*** Can maybe explain this is greater depth at the end, when we're working in
    Clojure?

--

== 10 minute break / exercise

* Write an E major scale (sharp notes: F#, C#, G#, D#)
** ...first, using accidentals (no `key-sig`)
** ...then, using `key-sig` (no accidentals)

* Give everyone ~2 minutes to figure it out themselves
* Walk through it myself (2 minutes)

[.notes]
--
* 15 minutes (including next slide)
* Go through the table line by line, show how to represent these in Alda
* Write a score like `c1 | c2 c | c4 c c c`
* Discuss how in Alda, it's easy to go outside of powers of 2
** `c1 | c2 c | c3 c c | c4 c c c | c5 c c c c`
** Add a midi-woodblock, to make the number of beats per note more obvious
** In most popular Western music, you'll only ever hear rhythms based on the
   powers of 2.
** Powers of 3 are also fairly common. In standard musical notation, we tend to
   refer to those rhythms in terms of _triplets_ and _sextuplets_.
